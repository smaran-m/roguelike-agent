# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## üìù Documentation Maintenance Notes

**IMPORTANT**: When making changes to the codebase, please update the following sections in this file:

- **Test count** (currently 342): Update when adding/removing test files
- **Component list**: Add new systems, managers, or utilities as they're created
- **Architecture section**: Update when system responsibilities change
- **Available scripts**: Sync with package.json when scripts are modified
- **Dependencies**: Update version numbers when upgrading packages

**Auto-sync locations**: 
- Test count: Search for "342" and update across all documentation
- Scripts: Match package.json scripts section exactly
- File structure: Reflect actual src/ directory organization

## Development Commands

### Building and Running
- `npm run dev` - Start development server (Vite) on port 3000 with auto-open
- `npm run build` - Build production version (TypeScript compilation + Vite build)
- `npm run preview` - Preview production build
- `npm run typecheck` - Run TypeScript type checking without emitting files
- `npm run test` - Run comprehensive test suite (342 tests) with Vitest
- `npm run test:ui` - Run tests with UI interface for development

### Development Workflow
The project uses Vite for development with hot module replacement. The game automatically opens in the browser at http://localhost:3000 when running `npm run dev`.

**Critical Development Process**:
1. **Always run `npm run dev` BEFORE running tests** - Manual verification should come first
2. Tests should be considered an additional validation step after manual functionality checks
3. Development workflow: `npm run dev` ‚Üí manual testing ‚Üí `npm run test` ‚Üí `npm run typecheck`
4. This ensures that features work correctly in the actual game environment before automated testing

### Debug Logging Control
The project includes a comprehensive verbose logging system to control console output:

**Verbose Flag Usage**:
- **Default Mode**: WARN level logging (quiet) - only warnings and errors appear in console
- **F12 Hotkey**: Press F12 during gameplay to toggle verbose mode on/off with visual indicator
- **Environment Variable**: Set `VITE_DEBUG_VERBOSE=true` in `.env` file for default verbose mode
- **Programmatic Control**: Use `Logger.setVerboseMode(true/false)` in code
- **Persistent Setting**: Verbose preference is saved to localStorage across sessions

**Console Output Levels**:
- **Quiet Mode (default)**: Only WARN and ERROR messages shown
- **Verbose Mode**: All DEBUG, INFO, WARN, and ERROR messages shown
- **High-frequency logging** (movement, audio events, rendering) only appears in verbose mode

## Architecture Overview

This is an emoji-based roguelike game built with TypeScript, PixiJS for rendering, featuring D&D-style combat mechanics, line of sight system, and smooth animations. The architecture follows a layered approach:

### Animation System
Animation system exists with GSAP integration but **partial implementation**:
- Smooth movement animations using requestAnimationFrame with linear interpolation
- Camera follows player movement smoothly
- **Note**: Visual effects (shake, floating damage, combat animations) exist but most are disabled in CombatManager

## Architecture Patterns

- **Modular Directory Structure**: Clean separation of concerns with organized directories (core, systems, managers, loaders, entities, ui)
- **System Extraction**: Extracted specialized systems (Camera, Font, Dice) from monolithic classes for better maintainability
- **Mixed Architecture**: Constructor parameter injection (not true dependency injection)
- **Callback Architecture**: InputHandler uses callbacks to decouple input from game logic
- **Single Responsibility**: Each system has a focused, well-defined purpose
- **Transitional EventBus Integration**: Some systems fully integrated, others still use direct coupling
- **Error Handling**: Centralized error management with context and error codes
- **Logging**: Structured logging with configurable levels and filtering
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Organized by system including EventBus, start screen UI, and world selection with deterministic behavior

## Development Commands for Claude

### Running Tests
- Use `npm run test` to run the full test suite before making changes
- Use `npm run test:ui` during development for immediate feedback with visual interface
- Tests use seeded randomness - maintain deterministic behavior in combat tests
- All tests should pass before considering work complete

### Code Quality
- Run `npm run typecheck` to ensure TypeScript compliance
- Follow established patterns: dependency injection, callback architecture, error handling
- Use the ErrorHandler.ts framework for error management
- Use the Logger.ts system for debugging and information logging with appropriate log levels (DEBUG for verbose info, WARN/ERROR for important messages)
- Enable verbose logging during development: Set `VITE_DEBUG_VERBOSE=true` in `.env` or press F12 in-game
- Maintain test coverage when adding new features

## Quality Assurance Notes

Based on recent test audits:
- 6/8 test files provide excellent functionality validation
- CombatSystem.test.ts and TileMap.test.ts are exemplary with proper seeded randomness
- Renderer.test.ts and InputHandler.test.ts have been identified as having structural issues
- When working on rendering or input systems, prioritize functional testing over mocking
- Maintain the principle: tests should validate actual behavior, not implementation details

Do what has been asked; nothing more, nothing less.
NEVER create files unless they're absolutely necessary for achieving your goal.
ALWAYS prefer editing an existing file to creating a new one.
NEVER proactively create documentation files (*.md) or README files. Only create documentation files if explicitly requested by the User.
