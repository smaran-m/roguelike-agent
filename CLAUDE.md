# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## üìù Documentation Maintenance Notes

**IMPORTANT**: When making changes to the codebase, please update the following sections in this file:

- **Test count** (currently 114+): Update when adding/removing test files
- **Component list**: Add new systems, managers, or utilities as they're created
- **Architecture section**: Update when system responsibilities change
- **Available scripts**: Sync with package.json when scripts are modified
- **Dependencies**: Update version numbers when upgrading packages

**Auto-sync locations**: 
- Test count: Search for "114+" and update across all documentation
- Scripts: Match package.json scripts section exactly
- File structure: Reflect actual src/ directory organization

## Development Commands

### Building and Running
- `npm run dev` - Start development server (Vite) on port 3000 with auto-open
- `npm run build` - Build production version (TypeScript compilation + Vite build)
- `npm run preview` - Preview production build
- `npm run typecheck` - Run TypeScript type checking without emitting files
- `npm run test` - Run comprehensive test suite (65+ tests) with Vitest
- `npm run test:ui` - Run tests with UI interface for development

### Development Workflow
The project uses Vite for development with hot module replacement. The game automatically opens in the browser at http://localhost:3000 when running `npm run dev`.

**Critical Development Process**:
1. **Always run `npm run dev` BEFORE running tests** - Manual verification should come first
2. Tests should be considered an additional validation step after manual functionality checks
3. Development workflow: `npm run dev` ‚Üí manual testing ‚Üí `npm run test` ‚Üí `npm run typecheck`
4. This ensures that features work correctly in the actual game environment before automated testing

- Default player and enemy stat blocks

**LineOfSight Class**: Visibility system with:
- Ray casting algorithm for realistic FOV
- Bresenham's line algorithm for line-of-sight checks
- Configurable visibility radius
- Light blocking tile support
- Explored vs currently visible tile states

### Game Systems

**Combat Mechanics**:
- Turn-based D&D-style combat with theme-specific variations
- Melee attacks with range checking (1 grid square)
- Attack rolls: d20 + ability modifier + proficiency bonus
- Damage types: Physical, elemental, magical (varies by world theme)
- Damage resistance/vulnerability system with configurable multipliers
- Multiple critical hit rules: double damage, max+roll, double dice
- Multi-resource system: HP, mana, theme-specific resources (heat, sanity, corruption, etc.)
- Character death at 0 HP

**Visibility System**:
- Real-time FOV calculation using ray casting
- Tiles marked as explored (permanent) vs visible (current)
- Light-blocking walls and obstacles
- Configurable sight radius (default 8 tiles)

**Entity System**:
- Full D&D-style character stats (6 abilities, HP, AC, level)
- Multi-resource entities with configurable resource types per world theme
- Player and enemy entities with different stat blocks
- Item-based damage types and resistance systems
- Unique entity IDs and visual representation
- Support for both emoji and ASCII character rendering

### Emoji System
The game uses Unicode emojis as glyphs for both tiles and entities. The rendering system automatically switches between `Noto Emoji` font for emojis and `Noto Sans Mono` for ASCII characters based on the `isEmoji` flag.

### Animation System
Smooth movement animations are implemented using requestAnimationFrame with linear interpolation. Collision feedback is provided through entity shake animations. Camera follows player movement smoothly.

- **Callback Architecture**: InputHandler uses callbacks to decouple input from game logic
- **Single Responsibility**: Each system has a focused, well-defined purpose
- **Error Handling**: Centralized error management with context and error codes
- **Logging**: Structured logging with configurable levels and filtering
- **Testing**: Comprehensive test coverage with deterministic behavior

## Development Commands for Claude

### Running Tests
- Use `npm run test` to run the full test suite before making changes
- Use `npm run test:ui` during development for immediate feedback with visual interface
- Tests use seeded randomness - maintain deterministic behavior in combat tests
- All tests should pass before considering work complete

### Code Quality
- Run `npm run typecheck` to ensure TypeScript compliance
- Follow established patterns: dependency injection, callback architecture, error handling
- Use the ErrorHandler.ts framework for error management
- Use the Logger.ts system for debugging and information logging
- Maintain test coverage when adding new features

## Quality Assurance Notes

Based on recent test audits:
- 6/8 test files provide excellent functionality validation
- CombatSystem.test.ts and TileMap.test.ts are exemplary with proper seeded randomness
- Renderer.test.ts and InputHandler.test.ts have been identified as having structural issues
- When working on rendering or input systems, prioritize functional testing over mocking
- Maintain the principle: tests should validate actual behavior, not implementation details
